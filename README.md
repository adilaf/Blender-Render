# Blender-Render
**This repository is for rendering blender scenes or stills in a .png format via a Google Colab notebook. **

_For you to successfully render you must:_

1. Create a new file in your GDrive titled "Blender".

2. Create a subfolder titled "Output" in the "Blender" file.

3. Upload your .blend file to the "Blender" folder you've just created.

4. In the colab notebook, mount your Google Drive and follow the prompts.

5. In the second section of code insert the file destination, this should look like (/drive/blender/filename.blend)
    {in the above example filename is referring to the name of your own .blend file, do not use it!}

6. Adjust your starting and ending frames.

7. Edit Output sile destination.

8. All you need to do now is press the play button for each consecutive piece of code.


_If you find error messages look at your file destinations, or if there any syntax errors.
If there are syntax errors, restart the notebook._
